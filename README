minetest-australopithecus-death-inventory-drop
==============================================

A system which makes the player drop their inventory on death.


Features
--------

 * Items "explode" away from the player, spreading them over a fair distance in
   all directions.
 * Certain percentage of items can be retained or be destroyed.
 * Completely configurable from the configuration.


Usage
-----

The system activates itself, you just need to add the mod to the subgame.


Configuration
-------------

The system can be configured by adding settings to the `minetest.conf`:

    # If the system should be activated, defaults to true.
    deathinventorydrop_activate = true
    
    # If the field should be set to disable automatically pickup provided
    # by the auto-pickup mod, defaults to false.
    autodrops_autopickup_disable = false
    
    # The value for the timeout before the auto-pickup mod is allowed to pick
    # it up, defaults to 2.
    autodrops_autopickup_timeout = 2
    
    # The name of the lists to drop, a comma separated list, defaults to "main".
    deathinventorydrop_inventories = main
    
    # The percentage of how many items are destroyed upon death, a random amount
    # is picked based on the given range, defaults to "0.15, 0.35".
    deathinventorydrop_percentage_destroyed_items = 0.15, 0.35
    
    # The percentage of how many items are retained, meaning the player is
    # allowed to keep after death, defaults to "0, 0.15".
    deathinventorydrop_percentage_retained_items = 0, 0.15
    
    # If the stacks that are split in some way, defaults to random.
    # Possible values are:
    #  random: The dropped stacks are split randomly.
    #  single: The dropped stacks are split into every single item.
    #  stack: The dropped stacks are dropped as they are.
    deathinventorydrop_split = random
    
    # The maximum velocity of newly dropped items, a list with x, y and z
    # values, defaults to "7, 10, 7".
    deathinventorydrop_velocity = 7, 10, 7


Drop additional items
---------------------

If you want to drop additional items, that is easily possible by invoking
`deathinventorydrop.drop_inventory`, which accepts the Player, the InvRef
and the name of the list to drop.

    minetest.register_on_dieplayer(function(player)
        -- Checking of the object exists allows us to define the dependency as
        -- optional.
        -- Checking if the system is active at all.
        if deathinventorydrop ~= nil and deathinventorydrop.active then
            -- Drops all items in the list and also clears the list.
            deathinventorydrop.drop_inventory(player, your_inventory, "your_list")
        else
            -- Do something different here.
        end
    end)


Force activation
----------------

You can force the activation of the system, even it has been disabled in
the configuration, by invoking `deathinventorydrop.activate_internal`.
